# Taschenrechner
Calculator one page web application.
A VueJs project.

# Project Development
1. First I learned about Vue, basic concept and the basic one page application creation.
2. Then I looked some similarities and differences between React and Vue. To understand more about it. And watched some basic videos on Youtube about Vue.
3. I created the project using Vue CLI "vue create". Used v2 version of Vue. And inspected the file structure and logic of Vue.
3. For the calculator project I wanted to use component structure, so I looked how components are in Vue.
4. Then I created the static structure (buttons, display, containers), not so fancy looking calculator.
5. I used event handlers in Vue to communicate with parent components.
6. I determined the states required for the app. And looked how states work in Vue.
6. For the math. operations and possible cases I wrote helper functions.
6. Tested, found new cases, and improved, corrected the functions accordingly.
6. Implemented a new, better looking design.
7. If I had more time, I would
    * add a memory function for the past results
    * add a delete button to erase last number
    * learn about vuetify framework
    * add more features, operations etc.
